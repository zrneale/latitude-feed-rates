Abstract: Rising global temperatures have profound implications for predator-prey interactions, which are central to ecosystem dynamics. While predator feeding rates are known to vary with temperature, how this relationship varies within species across the different climatic regions conditions they inhabit is poorly understood. Here we address this knowledge gap by experimentally measuring the thermal responses of predators collected from multiple populations at three latitudes spanning most of the continental US (a gradient of 11°). Specifically, we recorded the per-capita feeding rates of predators from a given population and latitude across an experimental temperature gradient ranging from 5-35°C to quantify the thermal response curves for each predator population. We found stark differences in thermal responses across latitudes ranging from clear humped shape curves to a mostly linear increase. Most notably, these intraspecific differences in the overall shapes of thermal responses reveal opposing latitudinal patterns depending on the range of temperature considered. These results reveal that local climate can shape how interactions respond to warming and highlight the need to consider past local climatic conditions when predicting responses of natural systems to climate change at the local, regional, and global scale.
